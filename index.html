      <p>Contributing to OSS one line at a time</p>
    </div>

    <h2 class="yellow">Quick intro</h2>
    <p>We are a group of passionate software engineers that tries to meet
    regularly to contribute together to Open Source Software.</p>

    <h2 class="yellow">Goals</h2>
    <p>Everytime we meet, we try to get out of the meetup with a visible
    contribution that we present to each other and that we advertise here.
    We want to 
      <ul>
        <li class='description'>Contribute</li>
        <li class='description'>Learn</li>
        <li class='description'>Share</li>
      </ul>
    </p>

    <h2 class="yellow">Rules</h2>
    <p>Actually, those are more guidelines, being built as we go:
      <ul>
        <li class='description'>
          Come open minded. You might be an XXX
          developer and end up working on YYY technology. So what?
        </li>
        <li class='description'>
          Come with an idea. Everyone should come with an OSS project that he
          wants to work on and share
        </li>
        <li class='description'>
          Add your idea to our <a
        href='http://bit.ly/osshacker-trello'>trello</a> and put yourself
      as an assignee.  if you don't have access to our trello yet, send a
      request to the organizer
        </li>
      </ul>
    </p>

    <h2 class="yellow">How it works</h2>
      <ul>
        <li class='description'>We say hello and chat a bit waiting for
          everybody to arrive</li>
        <li class='description'>We bring up the trello and everyone speak
          about the project they want to work on</li>
        <li class='description'>We pair based on technology/project/affinity</li>
        <li class='description'>We hack (possibly on several projects)</li>
        <li class='description'>At the end, every group has 5 minutes to
          present their contribution</li>
      </ul>
    </p>
