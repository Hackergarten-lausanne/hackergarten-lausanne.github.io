## Attendees
Chris, Vincent, Ludovic, Nikolche and Greg

## What we did
We had a rocky start. We don't know each other, we had little to no rule, ...
Choosing what to work on ended up being a bit tricky. That's why at the end we
reflected on how to organize better and that's why there now is a webpage with
some guidelines (that will surely evolve).

We ended up with everybody helping Chris to work on
[n3-line-chart][n3-line-chart]. It is a
library used in angular to wrap d3js graph generation into a nice angular
compatible API. The v2 of this library is being written from scratch in
Typescript, so it was the occasion to discuss a lot of things: typescript,
javascript, d3js, mocha, protractor, ...

At the end of the session, we had about 50% of the code for a new class of the
v2 that would display bar-charts. I can see that Chris posted a [PR][n3-pr] 2 days
after :)
